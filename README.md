<h1 align="center">🐶 Add Pug to Svelte</h1>

## ❓ What is this?
This is an **experimental** command to run to add Pug to your SvelteKit project or Vite-powered Svelte app.

## 🧰 Adding to SvelteKit
You must start with a fresh copy of the official SvelteKit template, which is currently created by running this command:
```sh
npm init svelte@next
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up Pug:
```sh
npx svelte-add Leftium/pug-adder
```

## ⚡️ Adding to Vite
You must start with a fresh copy of the official Vite-powered Svelte app template, which is currently created by running this command:
```sh
npm init @vitejs/app  # Choose svelte or svelte-ts
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up Pug:
```sh
npx svelte-add Leftium/pug-adder
```

## 🛠 Usage
After the adder runs,
* You can write Pug syntax in the <template lang="pug"> blocks in Svelte files.

* You can apply *another* [Svelte Adder](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-adders) to your project for more functionality.
